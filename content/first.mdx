# Introduction to Machine Learning: A Beginner's Guide

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn from data and make predictions. This guide will introduce key ML concepts, types, and applications.

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is a field of AI that focuses on developing algorithms that allow computers to improve performance on a task without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of Machine Learning

- **Supervised Learning**: The model learns from labeled data.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: The model finds patterns in unlabeled data.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.

## Applications of Machine Learning

- Fraud detection in banking
- Personalized recommendations (Netflix, Amazon)
- Medical diagnosis and image recognition
- Autonomous vehicles

ML is revolutionizing industries by enabling automation and intelligent decision-making. Stay tuned for more in-depth discussions on ML techniques.
