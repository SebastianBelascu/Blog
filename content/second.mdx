# Building Your First Machine Learning Model in Python

In this tutorial, we will build a simple **Supervised Machine Learning model** using Python and the **Scikit-Learn** library.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Step 1: Import Libraries
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
```

## Step 2: Load Data
```python
data = {
    "YearsExperience": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
    "Salary": [30000, 35000, 40000, 45000, 50000, 55000, 60000, 65000, 70000, 75000]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
X = df[["YearsExperience"]]
y = df["Salary"]
```

## Step 3: Split Data
```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

## Step 4: Train Model
```python
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

## Step 5: Make Predictions
```python
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print("Mean Squared Error:", mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))
```

## Step 6: Visualize Results
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.scatter(X, y, color="blue")
plt.plot(X, model.predict(X), color="red")
plt.xlabel("Years of Experience")
plt.ylabel("Salary")
plt.show()
```

This basic linear regression model predicts salary based on years of experience. Experiment with more complex models as you advance!
