# Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning: Key Differences

Understanding the difference between **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning is crucial in Machine Learning. Both approaches serve different purposes and are applied in various domains.

## What is Supervised Learning?

Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data. The model learns the relationship between input features and the correct output.

### Examples:
- Spam email detection (label: spam or not spam)
- Predicting house prices based on historical data

## What is Unsupervised Learning?

Unsupervised learning involves training a model on unlabeled data. The model finds hidden structures in the data.

### Examples:
- Customer segmentation in marketing
- Anomaly detection in cybersecurity
